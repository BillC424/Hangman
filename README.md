# Hangman
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman

Command line based hangman game where the computer generates a secret word that the human player attempts to guess letter by letter. The secret word is generated by picking a random word from a txt file. At the beginning of the game, the human player can load a previously saved game. This is accomplished by using a YAML file. The game can be saved during any round.
